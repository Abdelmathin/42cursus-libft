# 42cursus-libft
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

## ft_atoi:
     The ft_atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed
     to by str to int representation.
