# 42cursus-libft
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

## ft_atoi:
     The ft_atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str to int
     representation.

## ft_bzero:
     The ft_bzero() function writes n zeroed bytes to the string s.  If n is zero, ft_bzero()
     does nothing.

## ft_strjoin
```c
               char *ft_strjoin(char const *s1, char const *s2); 
```
     The purpose of the "strjoin" function is to concatenate or join two strings together into a single string.
     It takes two input strings as arguments and returns a new
     string that contains the combined contents of both input strings.
