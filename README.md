# 42cursus-libft
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

## ft_atoi:
     The ft_atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str to int
     representation.

## ft_bzero:
     The ft_bzero() function writes n zeroed bytes to the string s.  If n is zero, ft_bzero()
     does nothing.
